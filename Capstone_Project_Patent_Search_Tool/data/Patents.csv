Unlike a typical heat sink or heat fins, the thermal shield may have a low profile and be configured to spread a rapid onset of heat at a localized point or area (e.g., a location of an internal short) to a wider area to reduce a peak (maximum) temperature caused by a short of a battery. The thermal shield may be at least partially formed of graphite which may be adhered to the battery.",AMAZON TECH INC,NACHMAN RAMEZ;;SRINIVAS VIKRAM;;LIM JAMES ROBERT;;TANG PATRICK JEE;;WYNNE DAWNELLE IVY,AMAZON TECHNOLOGIES INC (2017-04-18),https://lens.org/051-490-271-491-062,Granted Patent,yes,6,6,1,051-490-271-491-062,US,1,051-490-271-491-062,US,0,H01G11/18;;H01M10/0525;;H01M10/613;;H01M10/617;;H01M10/623;;H01M10/647;;H01M10/653;;H01M10/655;;H01M10/658;;H01M50/202;;H01M2220/30;;Y02E60/10;;H01G11/18;;H01M10/0525;;H01M10/613;;H01M10/617;;H01M10/623;;H01M10/647;;H01M10/653;;H01M10/655;;H01M10/6551;;H01M10/658;;H01M50/202;;H01M2220/30,H01G11/18;;H01M10/0525;;H01M10/62;;H01M10/623;;H01M10/65;;H01M10/6551;;H01M50/202,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The thermal portion comprises two thermal walls, which are operable as the bottoms of the two enclosure portions and form a thermal cavity between these thermal walls. In some examples, the enclosure is a monolithically cast component. Alternatively, the enclosure can be partially cast with one thermal wall welded thereafter to a cast subassembly. The battery module also comprises two sets of batteries, each positioned into a corresponding enclosure portion. Each battery set is interconnected with an interconnecting assembly, positioned between the battery set and the corresponding cover, for this enclosure portion.",HARBINGER MOTORS INC,GOW PHIL;;KAWANISHI KENNETH;;WEICKER PHILLIP JOHN;;RHEBERGEN CODY;;HARRIS III JOHN HENRY;;PHAN VU;;FRICKE MICHAEL CARL;;MCCARRON DANIEL;;BOURKE DEBORAH,HARBINGER MOTORS INC (2023-09-12),https://lens.org/100-128-587-411-640,Granted Patent,yes,55,2,5,100-128-587-411-640;;049-858-352-573-466;;190-620-669-421-956;;132-350-505-128-306;;184-590-386-561-420,US;;WO,11,036-927-570-434-637;;190-620-669-421-956;;070-206-205-356-645;;131-198-950-229-324;;132-350-505-128-306;;100-128-587-411-640;;055-654-455-403-577;;024-306-739-187-487;;049-858-352-573-466;;167-152-816-133-578;;184-590-386-561-420,US;;WO,0,Y02E60/10;;H01M50/249;;H01M10/613;;H01M10/658;;H01M50/233;;H01M10/6556;;H01M50/224;;H01M10/625;;H01M50/213;;H01M50/209;;H01M10/658;;H01M10/613;;H01M2220/20;;H01M50/233;;H01M50/249,B60K1/04;;H01M10/613;;H01M10/658;;H01M50/233;;H01M50/249,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The thermal shield is positioned above the venting ends of one or more batteries, and various battery pack electrical components may be placed above the thermal shield. Gases and particulate matter from battery venting are thus intercepted and deflected by the thermal shield, instead of damaging battery pack electrical components. In this manner, various battery pack electrical components may be placed above battery venting ends without risk of damage. This allows for a more compact and versatile arrangement of battery pack components.",RIVIAN IP HOLDINGS LLC,BASERI EHSAN;;BUTTERFIELD KYLE;;SEKAR VIGNESH,RIVIAN AUTOMOTIVE LLC (2021-07-23);;RIVIAN IP HOLDINGS LLC (2021-07-24),https://lens.org/187-506-454-956-614,Granted Patent,yes,7,0,4,086-265-232-606-110;;187-506-454-956-614;;030-352-407-492-64X;;109-097-225-615-417,US;;DE;;CN,4,086-265-232-606-110;;187-506-454-956-614;;030-352-407-492-64X;;109-097-225-615-417,US;;DE;;CN,0,H01M10/658;;H01M10/625;;H01M10/625;;H01M10/658;;H01M50/209;;H01M50/30;;H01M2220/20;;Y02E60/10;;H01M10/6554;;H01M10/625;;H01M10/658;;H01M2220/20,H01M10/6554;;H01M10/625;;H01M10/658,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
